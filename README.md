## About
The picoAUDIO is a fully featured audio solution specially made for the TinyPICO ESP32 development board, featuring an I2S Stereo DAC, I2S Mono MEMS Microphone, builtin 3.7W Stereo Amplifier, dedicated Headphone Amplifier, I2C GPIO Extender and built-in MicroSD card reader.

We utilise a low power NXP UDA1334A IC featuring a clear digital 16/20/24 bit, 44.1kHz, stereo audio DAC. Accompanying the DAC is a Knowles SPH0645 I2S digital mono microphone. This miniature low power MEMS microphone provides a low noise, 24 bit, 44.1kHz stream. Complimenting the DAC is the powerful Maxim MAX98306 3.7W stereo class D amplifier with stero speaker terminals and a Texas Instrumets TPA6132A2 stereo headphone amplifier with 3.5mm audio jack.

A simple mounting socket hosts the TinyPICO development board and connects all of these great features together in a seamless and easy to utilise footprint measuring a tiny 33 mm x 57 mm (1.29in x 2.24in). To provide maximum connectivity the board features a built-in MicroSD card reader and GPIO extender to hookup 8 inputs and outputs for all of your button and LED needs.

## Features
The software and hardware used in this project have been made possible by the principle of open hardware and software. Many of the samples have been collected together from a variety of authors and modified to work out of the box with the picoAUDIO for instructional purposes. Please consult each sample project for relevant license and credit.
