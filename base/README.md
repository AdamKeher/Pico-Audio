## Features:
* Raises the picoAUDIO board off the benchtop giving clearance to the pins on the underside of the board.
* Built in standoffs and a flat bottom provide more contact points to the board, increasing stability.
* The bottom of the stand has cut outs to allow the underside pin markings to be visible.
* Does not increase the boards footprint.

## Note
This base requires 2.5mm / M2.5 screws to fix the picoAUDIO to the mounting posts on the base. It is suggested that nylon screws be used to minimise the chance of shorting nearby buttons. If metal screws are used, ensure the head size is small enough to avoid contact with the buttons.
